	-- workflow : navigate to : https://x.com/i/bookmarks (or automatically?) -> use DOM to extract bookmarks [contents , URLs, images(??)] -> simulates scrolling to dynamically load more bookmarks -> continues extracting until all -> extracted bookmarks are stored in csv/json (local storage??) -> fetch it randomly a day and add a side-div-element for this(??)

	-- how to store the file?
		--- if it is large? -> (??)
			---- csv 
		--- if it is small? -> chrome storage sync [working for now]

	-- random function to show a bookmark: 
		--- const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * bookmarks.length);
			const selectedBookmark = bookmarks[randomIndex];
	-- yes, changes daily. 
		---chrome.alarms.create('dailyBookmark', {
			  periodInMinutes: 1440 // Once per day (60 min * 24 hours)
			});


	-- problems
		--- webhook for detecting new bookmarks[have to intercept network request for "createBookmark"]
			---- how to deal with deletebookmarks??? {no network requests!!}
		--- large number of bookmarks [>100 would fail the chrome storage] -> store it in indexdB (??)
		--- dynamically changing bookmarks. [un-bookmarked a tweet]

	--additions : 
		--- also , put your gemini api key to to render a perfect search result on this div element. [more links  related to this tweet]
